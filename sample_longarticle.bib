	title = {Interaction Matters: A Note on Non-asymptotic Local Convergence of Generative Adversarial Networks},
	abstract = {Motivated by the pursuit of a systematic computational and algorithmic understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}), we present a simple yet uniﬁed non-asymptotic local convergence theory for smooth two-player games, which subsumes several discrete-time gradient-based saddle point dynamics. The analysis reveals the surprising nature of the o↵-diagonal interaction term as both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, this interaction term explains the origin of the slow-down e↵ect in the convergence of Simultaneous Gradient Ascent ({SGA}) to stable Nash equilibria. On the other hand, for the unstable equilibria, exponential convergence can be proved thanks to the interaction term, for four modiﬁed dynamics proposed to stabilize {GAN} training: Optimistic Mirror Descent ({OMD}), Consensus Optimization ({CO}), Implicit Updates ({IU}) and Predictive Method ({PM}). The analysis uncovers the intimate connections among these stabilizing techniques, and provides detailed characterization on the choice of learning rate. As a by-product, we present a new analysis for {OMD} proposed in Daskalakis, Ilyas, Syrgkanis, and Zeng [2017] with improved rates.},

	abstract = {Motivated by applications in Game Theory, Optimization, and Generative Adversarial Networks, recent work of Daskalakis et al [8] and follow-up work of Liang and Stokes [11] have established that a variant of the widely used Gradient Descent/Ascent procedure, called “Optimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent ({OGDA})”, exhibits last-iterate convergence to saddle points in unconstrained convex-concave min-max optimization problems. We show that the same holds true in the more general problem of constrained min-max optimization under a variant of the no-regret Multiplicative-Weights-Update method called “Optimistic Multiplicative-Weights Update ({OMWU})”. This answers an open question of Syrgkanis et al [19].},

The geometric approach we take also clarifies the roles of controllability and observability in the theory of the {ARE}. In addition, we discuss the properties of a special subset of the solution set of the {ARE}, the unmixed solutions, and find that they exhibit many of the same properties as the extremal solutions, \$K{\textasciicircum} +  \$ and \$K{\textasciicircum} -  \$.},
